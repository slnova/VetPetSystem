the set up of these files is for linux,but on a windows system you can just
copy the code out of the src diretory.

Doxygen was used to generate the html documentation for this code
(this can be found in the directory doc).If you want to update the
doc,make sure you have doxygen and the dot programs installed.


Directories:
	
	src - source java files
	doc - documentation in html
	bin - contains java class files
   Makefile - linuxmakefileof compiling and running of the system
